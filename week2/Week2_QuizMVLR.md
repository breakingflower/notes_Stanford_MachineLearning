# Quiz: Linear Regression with multiple variables

## Question 1

Suppose $m=4$ students have taken some class, and the class had a midterm exam and a final exam. You have collected a dataset of their scores on the two exams, which is as follows:

![q1 example table](q1_exampletable.png)

You'd like to use polynomial regression to predict a student's final exam score from their midterm exam score. Concretely, suppose you want to fit a model of the form $\mvlrHypotSum$ (with $n=2$)â€‹, where $x_1$ is the midterm score and $x_2$ is (midterm score)$^2$. Further, you plan to use both feature scaling (dividing by the "max-min", or range, of a feature) and mean normalization.

What is the normalized feature $x_2^{(2)}$? (Hint: midterm = 72, final = 74 is training example 2.) Please round off your answer to two decimal places and enter in the text box below.

Normalized feature:

$$x_1 \leftarrow \frac{x_i - \mu_i}{s_i}$$

Which equates to

$$x_2^{(2)} \leftarrow \frac{\overbrace{5184}^{x_i} - \overbrace{(7921 + 5184 + 8836 + 4761)/4}^{\mu_i = \textnormal{average}}}{\underbrace{8836 - 4761}_{s_i}} = -0.36601 = -0.37$$

## Question 2

You run gradient descent for 15 iterations with $\alpha=0.3$ and compute $J(\t{})$ after each iteration. You find that the value of $J(\t{})$ increases over time. Based on this, which of the following conclusions seems most plausible?

* [ ] $\alpha=0.3$ is an effective choice of learning rate.

* [ ]Rather than use the current value of $\alpha$, it'd be more promising to try a larger value of $\alpha$ (say $\alpha$=1.0).

* [x] Rather than use the current value of $\alpha$, it'd be more promising to try a smaller value of $\alpha$ (say $\alpha$=0.1).

## Question 3

Suppose you have $m=14$ training examples with $n=3$ features (excluding the additional all-ones feature for the intercept term, which you should add). The normal equation is $\normalEqGeneric$. For the given values of $m$ and $n$, what are the dimensions of $\t{}$, $X$ and $y$ in this equation?

Rationale: 

$X$ is an mx(n+1) matrix (including the intercept term). $y$ is an m-dimensional vector. Using a random example in octave, we get:

>> X = rand(14,4)
X =

```

Which shows us that the output $\t{}$ is of dimension $(n+1)$x1. 

In total

* dim X = 14 x 3+1 = 14x4
* dim y = 14x1
* dim $\t{}$ = 4x1

## Question 4

Suppose you have a dataset with $m=10^5$ examples and $n=2*10^4$ features for each example. You want to use multivariate linear regression to fit the parameters $\t{}$ to our data. Should you prefer gradient descent or the normal equation?

Rationale: 
If $n<10^3$ the normal equation is preferred. Here, $n$ is sufficiently large to use GD.

* [ ] Gradient descent, since it will always converge to the optimal $\t{}$.
* [ ] The normal equation, since it provides an efficient way to directly find the solution.
* [ ] The normal equation, since gradient descent might be unable to find the optimal $\t{}$.
* [x] Gradient descent, since $(X^TX)^{-1}$ will be very slow to compute in the normal equation.

## Question 5

Which of the following are reasons for using feature scaling?

* [ ] It prevents the matrix $(X^TX)^{-1}$ (used in the normal equation) from being non-invertable (singular/degenerate).
* [x] It speeds up gradient descent by making it require fewer iterations to get to a good solution.
* [ ] It speeds up gradient descent by making each iteration of gradient descent less expensive to compute.
* [ ] It is necessary to prevent the normal equation from getting stuck in local optima.
